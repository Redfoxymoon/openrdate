20060918 - Finally updated the package to the latest OpenBSD rdate version.  I
know I should have done it sooner, but, you know, things pile up.  The primary
difference is that ntp.c has been set to handle ntp responses with ALARM
status.
20050211 - First packaging and deployment of openrdate.  Added configuration and makefile files.  Defined a SA_LEN macro in ntp.c.  Added an inclusion of config.h and changed an #ifdef in rdate.c
