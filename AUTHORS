20050211 - It has been my supreme pleasure to turn this piece of OpenBSD software into a package for use by non-OpenBSD users.  All copywrites and licenses are that of the original coder (I abhor borrowed plumage) and have applied my copywrite to only the code I've added.  But that being said, all errors and omissions are mine and mine alone.  If you find any, feel free to email at the address below.

The original authors and copywrite holders of this code are as follows:

David Mazieres <dm@lcs.mit.edu>
Thomas Roessler <roessler@sobolev.rhein.de> - thanx for the arc4random code!
N.M. Maclaren
Thorston "mirabile" Glaser
